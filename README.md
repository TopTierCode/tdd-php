## How to use this project
Each chapter contains its own folder. Each time EITHER the test OR the 
implementing class are modified in the book, a new folder was created.
The changes are linear. When either the implementation or test file is
modified, a new folder (A,B,C etc) is created. Any test that will fail
is marked as skipped.
